- 👋 Hi, I’m @IMIJinn
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching you how to use Git and GitHub (mostly)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to fulfil wishes outside the internet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making my purpose even easier to execute. So give me feedback.
- 📫 How to reach me write me here. I'll get back at you :D
- 😄 Pronouns: as a genie, I don't have any. Any of them is good.
- ⚡ Fun fact: One day I'd like to have a game of my own. Much like [Shantae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantae)
